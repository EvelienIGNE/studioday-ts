# IGNE Studio Day - TS

This project serves as base for the igne studio day about Typescript.  
Let's play around and do some exercise!

## Before you start

- ⚠️ You are supposed to learn something. So please disable any AI plugins you have running, like copilot.
- This repo uses eslint and prettier. It is recommended you install and configure them as described in the [employee handbook](https://www.notion.so/online-docs/Code-Consistency-8b8723f43a6647b2b94453ced0790148).

## How to

You cloned the `all-exercises` branch. Please start by creating a new branch to play on:

```
git checkout -b your-name
```

As you can see, there is a folder with exercises. You can just edit the exercise files.  
Solutions are provided in a separate folder, for when you get stuck or want to compare it with your own solution.
